- **Time-Series Decomposition**: Seasonal patterns and growth projections
- **Budget Insights**: Cost-efficiency and financial investment breakdowns

## 🔍 Visualizations Included

- Gantt Charts: Space race timelines, company launches
- Sunburst Charts: Hierarchical view of country → company → mission outcome
- Heatmaps: Launches by year, country, and company
- Word Cloud: Popular launch vehicles
- Choropleth Maps: Global launch and failure densities
- ARIMA Forecasts: Future launch trends (e.g., CASC growth prediction)

## 🔮 Key Insights

- The USSR dominated launches in the 20th century; the USA led in innovation.
- CASC (China) and SpaceX are rapidly growing in the 21st century.
- Countries like India, Japan, and France demonstrate cost-effective mission strategies.
- Private-public collaboration is reshaping the space industry’s future.
- Predictive models project exponential mission growth post-2020.

## 🚀 Future Work
